# Hahn Software Assessment Task

This solution is a full stack app with **backend** and **frontend** developed using .NET Core 8 and Vue, respectively.

The database used for the backend is set to be running in a Docker container, as you can see on the `docker-compose.yml` file, as well as the WebAPI and the WorkerServer. But feel free to change the connection string to the MSSQL server of your preference.
